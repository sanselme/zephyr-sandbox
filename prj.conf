# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================
# This file contains Kconfig configuration options for the Zephyr RTOS project.
# These settings control various system behaviors, libraries, and build options.
# ==============================================================================

# ==== Swift Language Support ====

# Enable Swift language support in the Zephyr project.
# This configuration allows the use of Swift for application development.
CONFIG_SWIFT=y

# ==== System Configuration ====

# Enable static initialization for GNU toolchain.
# This configuration ensures that static constructors and destructors
# are properly initialized when using the GNU toolchain.
CONFIG_STATIC_INIT_GNU=y

# Enable console output to be directed to standard output.
# This allows debug messages and application output to be visible.
CONFIG_STDOUT_CONSOLE=y

# ==== Library Configuration ====

# Enable the Newlib C standard library implementation.
# Newlib provides a more complete set of standard C library functions
# and is suitable for embedded systems requiring advanced features.
CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=y

# Enable the minimal C library implementation.
# This is a lightweight C library suitable for embedded systems with limited resources.
CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC=y

# Disable Picolibc to avoid conflicts with Newlib.
# Picolibc is another C library implementation, but it cannot be used
# simultaneously with Newlib in this configuration.
CONFIG_PICOLIBC=n

# ==== Boot Configuration ====

# Enable MCUboot bootloader support.
# MCUboot is a secure bootloader designed for microcontroller-based systems.
# Uncomment the following line to enable MCUboot integration.
# CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y

# ==== Build Output Configuration ====

# Enable generation of a HEX file as a build output.
# This is useful for programming the device with common flashing tools.
# Uncomment the following line to enable HEX file generation.
# CONFIG_BUILD_OUTPUT_HEX=y

# ==== Miscellaneous Configuration ====

# Enable printk support for logging and debugging.
# Printk is a lightweight logging mechanism used in Zephyr.
# CONFIG_PRINTK=y

# Enable the Hello module.
# This module provides a simple example application.
# Uncomment the following line to include the Hello module in the build.
# CONFIG_HELLO=y
